I switched my app store to the US store and now use my dollar card to pay for everything, from Apple Music to in-app purchase to subscriptions. 

Also, the ability to request money is a godsend!!!! I've found it especially helpful because I do not like confrontation and would rather not ask when someone owes me money.
