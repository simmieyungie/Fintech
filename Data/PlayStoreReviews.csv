4,"I've used Barter since the first web-only version was launched, and now the mobile app has more or less replaced my bank app. The thing I love the most about Barter is how it simplifies difficult things and makes it easy to send money to anyone anywhere in the world. I've taken to insisting that all my friends and family use Barter for money requests. 

The app lets you buy airtime, pay certain utility bills, and send money to any bank account anywhere in the world. My favorite features are the ability to create virtual Visa Dollar cards as well as the nearby feature which lets you send money to people near you. I switched my app store to the US store and now use my dollar card to pay for everything, from Apple Music to in-app purchase to subscriptions. 

Also, the ability to request money is a godsend!!!! I've found it especially helpful because I do not like confrontation and would rather not ask when someone owes me money. 

Last thing, bank transfers are cheaper when you do local transfers. I'm just saying.",2019-01-17 10:03:39,Ash is impressed,This App Is A Lifesaver!,False,,flutterwave

Now, the app has also gone the way of Alat, it isn‚Äôt just working. Thank God I withdrew most of what I had there in time, leaving the equivalent of just $2.
